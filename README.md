Computer Networks 2

Some of the skills I gained upon completing this module include:

1. How to provide an overall picture of how a computer may be integrated into a LAN and on into the Internet, from the point of view of the hardware required to do so and the software requirements.
2. How to distinguish between the various LAN technologies in use today, including the characteristics of the hardware and software components and the modes of operation of each.
3. How to appreciate the complexity of the construction of robust and non robust communications protocols and how issues such as latency, error detection and error correction are dealt with.
4. How to develop software using sockets for communications across a TCP\IP based internet.
