"what challenges did you face in doing the assignment and what were your solutions?"

I found the errors quite challenging, as soon as I got rid of one another popped up.
I found it hard to find where I was going wrong.

"what part of your submission are you particularly proud of?"

I think my code is very well commented and well structured.

"what did you learn from doing the assignment?"

I learned exactly how IP adresses work and how they fit into network classes,
and why each class require certain criteria.
I also learned what an API was as I'd never heard of one before this project.
I also noticed that I need to be paying more attention in lectures because I hadn't fully
copped how certain topics link (which I probably should have by this stage).

"what did you think of the assignment?"

I did enjoy it as a learning process, it sounds much scarier than it seems once you 
learn how to use the API.
I didn't love it purely because its not my best work as I just kept getting 
so frustrated with the errors, but it was a good learning experience in terms of 
having to understand exactly how IP addresses work and how everything fits and why.
